MarpaX-Tester

Marpa is a new parsing method that has a lot going for it - to make it easier
to work with, though, it's convenient to have some command-line tools to permit
test-driven development of the grammar before even delving into the code that
will use the grammar.

To that end, I wrote MarpaX::Tester, which includes both a module for convenient
testing and a command-line utility marpa-test.
